## Security policy

Caliginousoft takes security very seriously. This means protecting applications from common issues like CSRF, Script Injection, SQL Injection, and the like. But it also means a clear policy on how to report vulnerabilities and receive updates when patches to those are released.

#### Supported versions

For major security issues, all releases in the current major series, and the last release in the additional major series will receive patches and new versions.

For minor security issues, the current release series and the next most recent one will receive patches and new versions.

When a release series is no longer supported, itâ€™s your own responsibility to deal with bugs and security issues. We may provide backports of the fixes and publish them to git, however there will be no new versions released. If you are not comfortable maintaining your own versions, you should upgrade to a supported version.

The classification of a security issue is determined by the Caliginousoft team.
