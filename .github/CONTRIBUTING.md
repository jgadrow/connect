## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Is the bug a security vulnerability**, refer to our [security policy](SECURITY.md) to be sure that the vulnerability exists in a supported version.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/jgadrow/connect/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/jgadrow/connect/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Have a feature you'd like to request?**

* **Ensure the feature was not already requested** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/jgadrow/connect/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the need, [open a new one](https://github.com/jgadrow/connect/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug, adds a feature, or changes an existing one?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the project will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Submit an email to public@caliginousoft.com with any question. Be advised that this is a public domain project and, as such, not all emails will receive a response. Even if a response is received, there is no guarantee it will be in anything reasonably considered as "timely."

Thanks!
